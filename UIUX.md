1. Clear Layout and Navigation

   - The page layout is structured with an action sidebar on the left and a content area in the center.
   - All primary function buttons (e.g., "Add Element," "Edit Title," "Delete Slide") are grouped in the left sidebar for easy access, while the central area is dedicated to displaying and editing slide content.

2. Intuitive Buttons and Feedback

   - Ensure that button labels are clear, and provide feedback for user actions in real time.
   - Descriptive labels are added to each button and card for each presentation, hover effects were applied for immediate visual feedback.

3. Utilization of Standard UI/UX Patterns

   - Apply standard UI/UX design patterns that align with user expectations.
   - Common design patterns were used, such as clickable navigation arrows, and an Esc key shortcut to close modal dialogs.

4. Responsive Design Adaptation

   - Ensure a consistent user experience on mobile devices and smaller screens.
   - Responsive design (e.g., percentage-based widths and flexible layouts) is applied to automatically adjust layout and font sizes on smaller screens.

5. Optimal UI Colors and Contrast

   - Optimize color contrast for enhanced readability.
   - High-contrast colors were chosen for backgrounds, text, and buttons to meet accessibility standards. Complementary colors were used to keep the layout clean and visually comfortable.

6. Icon Integration for Buttons

   - Enhance the usability and visual clarity of primary action buttons by adding icons that represent each button's function.
   - Icons were added to key buttons (e.g., "Preview," "BACK," "LOGOUT," and "Delete PRESENTATION") to visually reinforce their functionality. For example, the "Preview" button has an eye icon, "Add presentation" has a plus sign icon and "Add Image" has a image icon
